1-7
Introduction, Voronoi
- back is as interesting as front
- orthogonal pleats
- indiscriminate set of points

8-11
Simple
- bring 3 points together, resolve material
- pleats lie upright

12-21
Easy pleat
- pleats: perpendicular
- triangle = bunched material

22-29
obtuse triangle case
- circumcenter
- does not work

30-42
isosceles unit
- right triangle
- solution for obtuse

43-47
Summary
- affine scale = voronoi

48-55
- affine scale
- strip grafting
- triangles = same 3 points

56-65
- overlapping
- obtuse = quadrilateral
- "overlap" : "overlapped" -- obtuse : ac/r/obt

66-74
Overlap solution
- watch out for obtuse edges

75-87
Handfolding
- voronoi + axioms
- Kawasaki
- tips

88-end
Conclusions
- complete solution
- subset of origamizer 
- origamizer folds pleats to the side
- realtime, javascript - online
- handouts for practice
